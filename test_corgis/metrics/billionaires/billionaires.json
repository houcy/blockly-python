    "description": "Researchers have compiled a multi-decade database of the super-rich. Building off the Forbes World's Billionaires lists from 1996-2014, scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire - including whether they were self-made or inherited their wealth. (Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)\n",
