    "description": "This dataset comes from the National Center for Educational Statistics' Common Core of Data. Data is available for every state and the District of Columbia from the 2009-2010 school year. The data is roughly categorized into four categories: funding, how much money is given to the school; score, how students perform academically; attendance, the rate at which students and teachers attend; enrollment, the size of the schools. Funding is given in dollars. The 'Year' field has records for Preschool, Kindergarten, and grades 1-12.\n",
