<p>
Earthquake records from around the world collected from the United States Geological Survey.  Important details about the earthquake such as distance, gap, magnitude, depth and significance are included to properly describe the earthquake.  Additionally, data about exact geological coordinates and a relative description of the earthquake's location is included. The earthquakes collected are from the past month.

At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor; for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude. Typically ranges from -1 (very tiny) to 10 (incredibly powerful).</td>
